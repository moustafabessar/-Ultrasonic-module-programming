Atmega32 is used to get distance from Usltrasonic 
This Driver is successfully tested on hardware, this main idea in this project is to set the led once ultrasonic measure distance from 1 to 50cm
I used timer0 to send trigger while i used input capturing with interrupt of timer1 to read the echo signal width from sensor
There is error up to 2cm
