1- Atmega32 is used to get distance from Usltrasonic.

2-This Driver is successfully tested on hardware, this main idea in this project is to set the led once ultrasonic measure distance from 1 to 50cm.

3- I used timer0 to send trigger while i used input capturing with interrupt of timer1 to read the echo signal width from sensor.

4- There is an error up to 2cm.
